NUMBER_SURGERY = 2;

NUMBER_OF_DAYS = 10; // you must edit this vars for number of deays you want simulate hospital process

from this resault you can make decision on add more beds to ICU or HOSPITAL_WARD ???

notice:
this programme make random days for new patients in ICU and HOSPITAL_WARD, this random number is between 1 and maxDaysForIcuAndHOSPITAL_WARD_BEDS.
